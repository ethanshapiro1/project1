 <h2>About Me</h2>  
<p>
    Here is a little bit about myself. My name is Ethan Shapiro, and I am from Los Angeles California. I have dreamt of attending the University of Miami since a very young age. My father grew up in the Miami area, which gave me a ton of exposure to the city of Coral Gables. When I was a sophomore in high school, my brother began his four year here at the U. I came to visit him, stayed in his dorm, and I knew exactly where I needed to be. I grew up with a passion for three sports. The three sports were baseball, basketball, and soccer. I played all three sports year round up until I was about 12 years old. I decided to stick to prominently baseball. I played baseball up until my senior year of high school. Baseball was my peace. My favorite thing to do was to just be out there on that field, in my crouch, catching pitches for all my brothers. It was my happy place. All good things come to an end,  and that happened when highschool drifted away from me. I am so lucky to have found my new happy place, which is the University of Miami.

<h2>SuperBowl 2022</h2>
<p>
    It happened again. The Los Angeles Rams are heading home to Sofi Stadium to take part in the 2022 super bowl. After an exciting off season, where the Rams added veteran quarterback, Matthew Stafford. Expectations for this team have been high since before the season started. Lots of analysts predicted that the Rams would make a long run in the playoffs. After a year where the Rams went 12-5 while taking down some of the toughest teams in the league, they battled through the playoffs, and now find themselves in the super bowl. The super bowl will be taking place in the Rams home stadium, against the Cincinnati Bengals. Matthew Stafford will be taking on second year quarterback out of Louisiana State University, Joe burrow, along with his strong wide receiver, Jamarr Chase. Personally, I love this matchup for the Los Angeles Rams. The Rams have a ton of veterans like Matthew Stafford, Jalen Ramsey, Aaron Donald, and Von Miller who will in my opinion take control of this game, and create a real mis-match on the defensive side of the ball. This is now the second time that the Rams will be playing in the Super Bowl since their relocation to Los Angeles.
